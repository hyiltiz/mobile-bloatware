# Inclusion criteria

- Impactful -- the app needs to be among the top 50 in its category (Productivity, Creativity etc.) according to the download count of a major software repository (Google Play Store, Apple's App Store etc.)

- Fatware: the app is 5 times larger than another app with a similar set of features (the "better" app needs to implement all essential features expected from the app, and at least half of the other "nice to have" features). For example, if a bank app A is 250 MB, and another bank app B is 50MB, and that they both have same "essential features" commonly expected (by most users) such as: 
   1. logging into the bank account, 
   2. viewing account summary, 
   3. depositing funds, and 
   4. transferring funds, 
then B provides all the essential features expected by a bank app. A may provide a few additional features (like direct chat access to the customer support, keeping track of your credit score, and promotions from some retailers), but those shouldn't expand the app to become 5 times largar than what was necessary. In cases where all competing apps are suspects of bloat, when legally appropriate, it is worthwhile to inspect how much each components (core logic, UI components, tracking and other data collection, debugging, dead code, useless assets, uncompressed assets etc.) of the app takes after a fresh install.

- Hoardware: the app consistently increases its size (by not routitely cleaning up its cache, accumulating tracking data or ads etc.) over time, and a reinstall recovers at least 20% of the space without taking more than 5 minutes to reconfigure. For example, if deleting a social app along with its data and cache, reinstalling it then logging into the app takes less than 5 minutes (ignoring network speed) but it can sync all chat history with the server so that no data important to the user is lost, then the app hoards data over time.
